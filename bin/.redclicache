I dropped this into a folder, which I then set to be shared publicly on the home network.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Returning to the lounge before my wife could start complaining about my absence, I downloaded a SSH app for my Samsung Galaxy S5.

It connected to the network using a different name; I SSH'd into it once more and the credentials had changed (NOOBS was `pi/raspberry`, whereas RasPlex was `root/rasplex`).\n\nOnce *Elementary* finished (which was only a few minutes more by this stage), I switched the TV over to the RasPlex HDMI input, then switched the cable from the old Pi to the new Pi 2. I fired up a fairly motion heavy movie, and...\n\nIt still stuttered.\n\nIt was about this time that I recalled a recent piece on the [Soap Opera Effect](http://imgur.com/gallery/SGbn9), and following that hunch, I turned off the 'Movie Plus' mode.\n\nI guess maybe I didn't need a Raspberry Pi 2 after all.  \nJust don't tell my wife.\n\n**TL/DR: Successfully (but ultimately unnecessarily) used an Android phone to SSH to a Raspberry Pi in order to overwrite the running operating system's partition with an image from a CIFS share.**","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":"Long","id":"34wn5g","gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Gambatte","media":null,"score":356,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2sfg5","edited":false,"link_flair_css_class":"long","author_flair_css_class":"tftsflair","downs":0,"mod_reports":[],"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"is_self":true,"name":"t3_34wn5g","permalink":"/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/34wn5g/encyclopædia_moronica_s_is_for_simple_solutions/","stickied":false,"created":1430827813.0,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/34wn5g/encyclopædia_moronica_s_is_for_simple_solutions/","author_flair_text":"Secretly educational","title":"Encyclopædia Moronica: S is for Simple Solutions","created_utc":1430799013.0,"ups":356,"num_comments":49,"visited":false,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"kind":"t3"},{"domain":"self.talesfromtechsupport","banned_by":null,"media_embed":{},"subreddit":"talesfromtechsupport","selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I work in tech support, as in over-the-phone technical representative.

My friend ($F) and I decided to get one of those computer certificates (ECDL or something),\nMind you we were only 13-14 years old then, and we wanted to learn. So we start this course that teaches people basics about computers, MS Windows and Office. Soon it was clear to me and my friend that we already knew all of the stuff that they were going to teach us. Our teacher figured that out too, and most of the time went for a coffee and left us to teach other students how to use Excel or make a database in Access. Since this is a small town in pretty rural part of my country me and my friend were one of the few people who dared to try and fix computers. Now this organisation that organised this courses got some budget for improving the computers. So instead of paying some company to fix the computers in the class, teacher decided to let my friend and me try to fix them up. Since we had a good knowledge of the computers, we told him what we would need: new Windows ME licences, more RAM, vacuum cleaner and a day to finish this off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First we decided what machines could get an upgrade (some of them were Pentium III machines, most of them Pentium II). The machines that would be left alone, were cleaned with the vacuum cleaner and then some virus removal was run to clean them up and make them a bit faster. The others were getting some RAM upgrades and if possible an upgrade to Windows ME.  This is where the story starts. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We split the workload he took 2 machines and I took the other 2 machines that were getting upgraded. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;bfo_skenda: Talking to my self: &amp;quot;Turn off the machines, unplug power, unplug all the cables, open the machine, vacuum, replace RAM, install Windows ME, Office etc..&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we got to work, in middle of the job my friend asks me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$F:  Hey, bfo_skenda, did you turn off the power from those machines. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;bfo_skenda: Yes, I flipped the fuse down, the first thing I did after turning them off. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbeknown to me, this particular machine was not connected to the same breaker on the fuse panel...\nAs my friend reached to unplug the RAM module, blue flash of light came from the motherboard and my friend was siting on the ground and lights went out in the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;$F. F&amp;amp;$&amp;amp;, bfo_skenda! I asked you if you turned the power off. F&amp;amp;$&amp;amp;! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;bfo_skenda: I did, I don&amp;#39;t know how that happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up, unplugged the machine and flipped the fuse back up. Lights came on, and my friend was still cursing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;bfo_skenda: What happened, what did you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;$F: I was using my screw driver to remove the hooks from the RAM modules and I missed the hook and hit the motherboard. Then I got hit by electricity. (He was using one of those small metal screw drivers.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;bfo_skenda: I started laughing and went to finish my work. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got paid for what we did, and It was a fun day at my first tech related work. Since that day I make sure that I disconnect all power sources before even opening the case of the computer. Just to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also trying to teach kids and middle aged people how to use computer prepared me for my life in tech field. (Like when a student on Computer Science college comes to me almost crying and ask me to help him setup his WiFi)  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR; Switch the power off on the fuse panel, wrong fuse switched, electricity strikes, my friend starts cursing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PS.

This is where the story starts. \n\n\nWe split the workload he took 2 machines and I took the other 2 machines that were getting upgraded. \n\n&gt;bfo_skenda: Talking to my self: \"Turn off the machines, unplug power, unplug all the cables, open the machine, vacuum, replace RAM, install Windows ME, Office etc..\"\n\nSo we got to work, in middle of the job my friend asks me:\n\n&gt;$F:  Hey, bfo_skenda, did you turn off the power from those machines. \n\n&gt;bfo_skenda: Yes, I flipped the fuse down, the first thing I did after turning them off. \n\nUnbeknown to me, this particular machine was not connected to the same breaker on the fuse panel...\nAs my friend reached to unplug the RAM module, blue flash of light came from the motherboard and my friend was siting on the ground and lights went out in the room. \n\n&gt;$F. F&amp;$&amp;, bfo_skenda! I asked you if you turned the power off. F&amp;$&amp;! \n\n&gt;bfo_skenda: I did, I don't know how that happened. \n\nI got up, unplugged the machine and flipped the fuse back up. Lights came on, and my friend was still cursing. \n\n&gt;bfo_skenda: What happened, what did you do?\n\n&gt; $F: I was using my screw driver to remove the hooks from the RAM modules and I missed the hook and hit the motherboard. Then I got hit by electricity. (He was using one of those small metal screw drivers.)\n\n&gt;bfo_skenda: I started laughing and went to finish my work. \n\n\nWe got paid for what we did, and It was a fun day at my first tech related work. Since that day I make sure that I disconnect all power sources before even opening the case of the computer. Just to be sure. \n\n\nAlso trying to teach kids and middle aged people how to use computer prepared me for my life in tech field. (Like when a student on Computer Science college comes to me almost crying and ask me to help him setup his WiFi)  \n\n\nTL;DR; Switch the power off on the fuse panel, wrong fuse switched, electricity strikes, my friend starts cursing. \n\n\nPS. Sorry for typos, please report them so I can fix it.  &lt;3\n\n\n","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"link_flair_text":"Medium","id":"34x8nc","gilded":0,"archived":false,"clicked":false,"report_reasons":null,"author":"bfo_skenda","media":null,"score":53,"approved_by":null,"over_18":false,"hidden":false,"thumbnail":"","subreddit_id":"t5_2sfg5","edited":1430817216.0,"link_flair_css_class":"medium","author_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"mod_reports":[],"secure_media_embed":{},"saved":false,"is_self":true,"name":"t3_34x8nc","permalink":"/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/34x8nc/how_it_all_started_a_power_story/","stickied":false,"created":1430845760.0,"url":"http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/34x8nc/how_it_all_started_a_power_story/","author_flair_text":null,"title":"How it all started?

Whether it&amp;#39;s getting rid of a virus, or installing new hardware, I&amp;#39;m the guy my family asks. But there&amp;#39;s one thing I&amp;#39;m not allowed to do for some reason: networking. My dad absolutely hates when I touch anything in the network. He always blames broken things on the couple of rack servers I have in the basement for various things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up today to find my internet down on my laptop. I do the usual thing, reset the access point, and as that&amp;#39;s coming back up, I go check the servers connectivity. Huh. They&amp;#39;re down too, and they&amp;#39;re hardwired. So I go check my parents computer that&amp;#39;s plugged directly into the router. Nope. Nothing. Can&amp;#39;t ping the router even. So I go reset the router, and the network comes up for a minute or so, and then goes down again. Great. I try a few more times hoping I can get into the router webpage, but to no avail. So I get to go have the dreaded talk with my dad, because he&amp;#39;ll yell at me if I try and take the router out to flash the firmware, which is the usual fix on this thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Dad, the internet is down. I&amp;#39;ve tried resetting the router, and the network comes up for a minute, and then goes down again. I can&amp;#39;t ping anything in the LAN when it is down.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Go unplug your servers from the network and then try again.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Dad, the servers aren&amp;#39;t even on right now. None of them have IPs.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Just go unplug them and try again! Your damn servers are always breaking things!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigh. There we go again. Blaming my servers. The only time anything to do with my servers broke the network is when I first got them and I plugged in the server switch to the main switch twice. I misread and thought it supported the spanning tree protocol. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when our network breaks it&amp;#39;s the router and we have to flash it and reinstall the firmware. Like when port forwarding started doing NAT on the IP so everything looked like it was coming from the router and not the client.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I go unplug it to appease him and try again and of course, nothing happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Dad, it didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Fine, let me take a look.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He goes upstairs on his laptop, which is on wireless at the moment, and immediately pulls up the router page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; What? How did you actually get the web page up? Nothing else in the network could.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Cause you were probably doing it wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep. I was pulling up a web page wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"/u/Sir7empest\"&gt;/u/Sir7empest&lt;/a&gt;, what&amp;#39;s the password?  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facepalm&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s ***********.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gets in looks at the network hosts and then asks me:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; What&amp;#39;s the IP of your servers?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; .2 through .5. Why?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Well that&amp;#39;s why the network is broke. Your damn servers have IPs outside of what the router DNS gives them.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yep. He said DNS. Not DHCP.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, but the IPs are still inside the broadcast domain for the router. Besides, that wouldn&amp;#39;t break it. They&amp;#39;ve had those IPs for months.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Well your damn servers are causing the issues. Ever since we got them they&amp;#39;ve been causing issues. I&amp;#39;m getting you your own router and static IP, so you&amp;#39;ll stop touching the family router.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigh. Great. Blaming my servers again. Honestly I&amp;#39;ve made our network better since I&amp;#39;ve started &amp;quot;messing&amp;quot; with it. Like making our four access points appear as one instead of four separate ones.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I walk out of the room, at my mom&amp;#39;s urging, cause I know he&amp;#39;ll just get more angry with me. I leave for a few minutes until I notice the network came back on.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Dad, what did you do.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; I rebooted the router, what else would I have done?&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you kidding me? I tried that multiple times.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He just grumbled and I went back down and did some work on my servers. After a few minutes he came down the the basement to talk to me.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; I changed the DNS to go from .2 to .255 instead of .100 to .255&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Dad. I think you have the tech aura.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; No. It&amp;#39;s cause your servers are unplugged right now.&lt;br/&gt;\n &lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Dad... the servers are still plugged in.&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Dad:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he just stalked off and I logged on to the router to fix the DHCP server that he had just turned off. Nothing but my servers was working at that point because they had static IPs. Uh huh. They broke the network.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; My dad fixed the network by doing the same thing I did.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","selftext":"Usual thing, long time lurker, first time poster, so sorry if I screw anything up and sorry for the long post.\n  \nLittle bit of background: I do most all of the tech support for my family when something breaks. Whether it's getting rid of a virus, or installing new hardware, I'm the guy my family asks. But there's one thing I'm not allowed to do for some reason: networking. My dad absolutely hates when I touch anything in the network. He always blames broken things on the couple of rack servers I have in the basement for various things.\n  \nI woke up today to find my internet down on my laptop. I do the usual thing, reset the access point, and as that's coming back up, I go check the servers connectivity. Huh. They're down too, and they're hardwired. So I go check my parents computer that's plugged directly into the router. Nope. Nothing. Can't ping the router even. So I go reset the router, and the network comes up for a minute or so, and then goes down again. Great. I try a few more times hoping I can get into the router webpage, but to no avail. So I get to go have the dreaded talk with my dad, because he'll yell at me if I try and take the router out to flash the firmware, which is the usual fix on this thing.\n  \n&gt; **Me:** Dad, the internet is down. I've tried resetting the router, and the network comes up for a minute, and then goes down again. I can't ping anything in the LAN when it is down.  \n&gt; **Dad:** Go unplug your servers from the network and then try again.  \n&gt; **Me:** Dad, the servers aren't even on right now. None of them have IPs.  \n&gt; **Dad:** Just go unplug them and try again! Your damn servers are always breaking things!  \n\nSigh. There we go again. Blaming my servers. The only time anything to do with my servers broke the network is when I first got them and I plugged in the server switch to the main switch twice. I misread and thought it supported the spanning tree protocol. &gt;&gt;\n  \nMost of the time when our network breaks it's the router and we have to flash it and reinstall the firmware. Like when port forwarding started doing NAT on the IP so everything looked like it was coming from the router and not the client.\n  \nAnyways, I go unplug it to appease him and try again and of course, nothing happens.\n  \n&gt; **Me:** Dad, it didn't work.  \n&gt; **Dad:** Fine, let me take a look.\n   \nHe goes upstairs on his laptop, which is on wireless at the moment, and immediately pulls up the router page.\n  \n&gt; **Me:** What? How did you actually get the web page up? Nothing else in the network could.  \n&gt; **Dad:** Cause you were probably doing it wrong.  \n  \nYep. I was pulling up a web page wrong.  \n\n&gt; **Dad:** /u/Sir7empest, what's the password?  \n \n*Facepalm*   \n\n&gt; **Me:** It's ***********.  \n\nHe gets in looks at the network hosts and then asks me:  \n\n&gt; **Dad:** What's the IP of your servers?  \n&gt; **Me:** .2 through .5. Why?  \n&gt; **Dad:** Well that's why the network is broke. Your damn servers have IPs outside of what the router DNS gives them.  \n\nYep. He said DNS. Not DHCP.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Yes, but the IPs are still inside the broadcast domain for the router. Besides, that wouldn't break it. They've had those IPs for months.  \n&gt; **Dad:** Well your damn servers are causing the issues. Ever since we got them they've been causing issues. I'm getting you your own router and static IP, so you'll stop touching the family router.  \n\nSigh. Great. Blaming my servers again. Honestly I've made our network better since I've started \"messing\" with it. Like making our four access points appear as one instead of four separate ones.  \n\nAt this point, I walk out of the room, at my mom's urging, cause I know he'll just get more angry with me. I leave for a few minutes until I notice the network came back on.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Dad, what did you do.  \n&gt; **Dad:** I rebooted the router, what else would I have done?  \n&gt; **Me:** Are you kidding me? I tried that multiple times.  \n\nHe just grumbled and I went back down and did some work on my servers. After a few minutes he came down the the basement to talk to me.  \n\n&gt; **Dad:** I changed the DNS to go from .2 to .255 instead of .100 to .255  \n&gt; **Me:** Dad.

Nothing but my servers was working at that point because they had static IPs. Uh huh. They broke the network.  \n\n**TL;DR:** My dad fixed the network by doing the same thing I did.
